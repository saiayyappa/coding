Count of Longest Consecutive 1's
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the count of longest consecutive 1's in the binary representation of
N as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 99999999
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of longest consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
55
Output:
3
Explanation:
The binary representation of 55 is 110111.
The first two bits and the last three bits are consecutive 1's.
The count of the longest consecutive 1's is 3.
Hence, 3 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1468
Output:
4
