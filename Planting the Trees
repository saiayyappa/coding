Planting the Trees
There is a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not planted. Flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. The
program must accept an array of size N consisting of only 0's (representing not planted) and 1's (representing planted) and an integer K
representing the number of plants to be planted as the input. The program must print Yes if K number of plants can be planted in the flowerbed.
Else the program must print No as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 50000
1 <= K <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N and K separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains either Yes or No.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 1
1 0 0 0 1
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
The elements of the array are 1 0 0 0 1 and K is 1
The first plot is already planted.
The second plot cannot be planted as it's left adjacent plot (first plot) is already planted.
In the third plot, the required plant can be planted as the adjacent plots are not planted.
Hence the output is Yes
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 2
1 0 0 0 1
Output:
No
