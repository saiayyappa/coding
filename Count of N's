Count of N's
The program must accept three integers N (represents a digit), X and Y as input. The program must print the count of N in the digits of each
integer(s) from X to Y (exclusive of X and Y).
Boundary Condition(s):
0 <= N <= 9
1 < Y <= 99999999
0 <= X < Y
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer value of N.
The second line contains the integers X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of N in the digits of each integer(s) from X to Y.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
50 55
Output:
4
Explanation:
The integers between 50 and 55 are 51, 52, 53 and 54.
Here, 5 has occurred 4 times.
Hence 4 is printed as the output
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
325 654
Output:
63
