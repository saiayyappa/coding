Even and Natural Number Series - Nth term
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the N term in the series as the output.
Note: The order of series must be 0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8, ....... This series must be a mixture of 2 series - all the odd terms
in the series consist of even numbers in ascending order and all the even terms in the series consist of natural numbers.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 999999999
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the N term in the series.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
Output:
4
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
17
Output:
16
